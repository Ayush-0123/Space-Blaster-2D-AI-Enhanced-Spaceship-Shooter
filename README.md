Game Logic Overview
Game State: The game operates on a simple state machine (MENU, PLAYING, PAUSED) to manage different screens and logic.

Game Loop: All game logic, including event handling, movement, shooting, and drawing, is processed within a central game loop.

Reset Function: A start_new_game() function ensures that all variables (health, position, bullets, etc.) are cleanly reset every time a new match begins, preventing bugs between sessions.

Power-Ups: Power-ups spawn randomly on either side of the screen. They have a limited lifespan and will disappear if not collected in time. The AI is programmed to actively seek out and collect power-ups on its side.
